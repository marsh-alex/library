### Overview:
This is a personal library app that can be used to track the books you have read and are planning to read. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the form, a user enters the title, author and 'read' status of a book and submit it. This information is then pushed onto an array and rendered in the form of a 'book tile' that contains the user inputs. The user inputs are also saved into local storage so the information can accessed if the page is refreshed or reopened. On each tile is a button with the ability to change the 'read' status of the book.
